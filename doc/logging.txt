Logging Plan
------------

RRD:
  * 1 RRD for Power Usage
  * 1 RRD per sensor for weather

Power Usage
===========

Raw Logging
^^^^^^^^^^^
  * Raw data is in the form of a counter
  * Need to compute rate of change based on last sample
  * Precise timing not required
  * Grab data as often as we like
  * Buffer into RabbitMQ
    + For RRD, if used, can store immediately
    + For DB, store after queue is above a certain length
      - For better bulk insert performance
      - Align to seconds (throw out any sub-second records)

Interval Logging
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  * Are "Last 24 Hour" type tables required (ala RRD)

Raw Display
^^^^^^^^^^^
  * For same day stats, can just group by the preferred interval
    + Should check on performance of GROUP BY with time filtering functions
    + Less critical if graphing agent is date-aware
    + Or, can we use a windowing function here?
    + Can also do some calc (min, max, avg) in app or api?

Historical Tables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
  * Size permitting, store full data in history tables (1 table/year)
  * Store per-day statistics (1 table/year)

Weather
=======

Raw Logging
^^^^^^^^^^^
  * Data is as-is (no need for deltas)
  * For both Arduino and Spark, grab data as it comes in
  * Buffer into RabbitMQ
  * Store after queue is above a certain length
    + For better bulk insert performance
