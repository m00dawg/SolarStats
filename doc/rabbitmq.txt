Arduino/XBee
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Producer:
    * Daemon Listener
    * Serial Interface
    * On Event, Validate Input (e.g. Temp within reasonable range)
    * Timestamp (if needed?)
    * Toss into RMQ

Consumer:
    * Runs periodically (cron?), ideally when queue may be large enough
      to justify a bulk insert, but short enough to be useful
      + Or, can process data immediately, but store into a
        memory table? Which is faster?
        Memory table would be more work overall when we already have
        storage view Rabbit, but makes for more realtime stats
        on the app side.
      + PHP seems to kinda suck for this, maybe also do this in C?
